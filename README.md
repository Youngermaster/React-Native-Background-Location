# React Native Background GeoLocation

The idea is to make a React Native app that can run the GeoLocation on the background. Just for testing an learning purposes only.

## Working fine

The one that works perfect is the one in the folder [RNExpoBackgroundLocationV2/](https://github.com/Youngermaster/React-Native-Background-Location/tree/main/RNExpoBackgroundLocationV2).
